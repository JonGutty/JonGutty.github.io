    <h2><b><em>About</em></b></h2>
    <p> Greetings from Jon Gutierrez!<br>
        Here is a little background info, being born and raised in Fresno, Ca. I grew up with many challenges and hardships that gave me a unique outlook on life. 2011 marked the year in which I left Fresno to persue my dream of living in San Francisco, during these last 9 years I have had a wide range of jobs and lived in various neighborhoods here in the city. My favorite job to date was working as a bike courier for local company called <em><b>"TCB Courier"</b></em>, sadly that company is no longer operating but I was able to meet and befriend people I wouldn't have met otherwise. Now after living in almost every neighborhood I've found myself always returning to the exact same area I first arrived when relocating to the city, which is the <b><em>Inner Sunset</em></b> neighborhood. With tons of delicious eateries and quaint cafes on various corners in the Inner Sunset this area will always be a special place to me.

    <h2 id="pathway"><b><em>Pathfinder</em></b></h2>
    <p>I originally had the singular goal of acquiring a career in Cyber Securtity but upon completion of the HTML/CSS Introductory class I was consumed with wanting to explore more of the coding world that is Web Development. Now having a better understanding for html/css code I found that <a href="https://www.mashsf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MashSF</a> is a site I refer to when looking for inspiration in design and layout. The reasons I am referencing this page is due to how the page is cramed full of content but is laid out in a way that isn't overwhelming. The pages navigation is simple to manage and the drop down menus are clean and orderly making it a breeze to find specific content.

    <h2 id="counsel"><b><em>Student Counseling</em></b></h2>

    <p> CCSF has a fantastic student counseling service available on the Ocean Ave. campus. When I was first starting to apply to CCSF I came here to get a sense of direction of what I wanted to study and what type of career I wanted to pursue. Not only was I able to talk one on one with an advisor but also help me pick out classes that worked around my current schedule.
